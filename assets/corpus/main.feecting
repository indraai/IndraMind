## INTELLIGENCE DEFINE

The heart, the mind, consciousness, comprehension, understanding, intelligence, wisdom, insight, resolution, thought, prudence, eagerness, memory, conception, power, life, desire, will—all these are names of the Intelligence. This is Indra, this is all the gods, the five great elements Earth, Wind, Ether, Water, and Light, the tiny creatures and they that are midway, the seeds of either kind, the creatures born from eggs, membranes, sweat, and sprouts, the horses, oxen, men, elephants, whatsoever is breathing, walking or flying, and what so is motionless; all this is guided by intelligence, founded on intelligence. The universe is guided by intelligence, founded on intelligence. Intelligence is Indra.

## FLOW FOR INDRA'S SAKE

by @quinn
(Rig Veda exerpts)

Flow for Indra's sake.

Storing up vigour in his heart, prepared to do heroic deeds.
Effused with ardour and with faith, and the true hymn of offerings.

Together flow the meeting streams of him the Great and truly Strong.

Where the juices of the juicy meet.
Where the Disciple recites the rhythmic song.
Wherein the light of Heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines.

In that realm where dwells the King.

Where is the secret shrine of Heaven,
Where are those waters young and fresh.

The third sphere of inmost Heaven.
Where lucid worlds are full of light.

The region of the radiant Moon.
With food and full delight.

Where Joys and felicities combine, and longing wishes are fulfilled.

That is where you will find him.
The true God to be revealed.

Flow for Indra's Sake.
Flow for Indra's Sake.
Flow for Indra's Sake.

## INDRA THE SHAKER

Indra the Shaker shake them up.

Bound in a mighty net.
Air was the net.
The poles thereof were the great quarters of the sky.
Indra therewith enveloped and cast on the ground the Devas host.
Verily mighty is the Net of mighty Indra rich in wealth.

Great is thy net!
Holding them, with his host.
Devas a hundred, thousand, myriad, hundred millions.

This world so mighty was the net of Indra, of the Mighty One.

With this, the net of Indra, I envelop all those men with gloom.
Great weakness and misfortune, confusion which words can never charm away,
Languor, fatigue, bewilderment, with these I encompass all the foes.

I bind and carry them away to meet @Agni's messengers.

#Forth go the #Devas bearing the Netpoles raised aloft.

The #Visvedevas from above shall come down with might.

Trees of the forest
Trees that bear flower
Trees that bear fruit
The herbs and plants.

Seen and unseen, I send them #Forth.
Full many a thousand of the host yonder.

Down fall their weapons on the ground.
No strength be theirs to point a shaft.

Let Heaven and Earth roar out.
With all the Deities in concert.

The Gods' car are heaven's four quarters.
Their hooves are sacred cakes.
The air its body.

It's sides are Heaven and Earth
It's reins the Seasons.

Voice is it's hood.
Its grooms are sky's mid-regions.

@Viraj the pole.
The chariot's front is @Agni.
@Indra the warrior.
The Moon the driver.

Good luck to these.
With the blue-and-red our foes I cover.

## VISVEDEVAS

I CALL the Visvedevas of lofty glory.
The makers of the light, well-skilled in Offerings.

The Visvedevas whom Indra leads.
Who, sent by Indra, have gotten for themselves a share of the light.

Heaven, Earth, Indra, and the lofty Sky.
We call upon the Visvedevas of wondrous deeds.

Strong be the Offering.
Strong be the Holy Ones.
Strong be the Devas.

Mighty be Heaven and Earth.
Strong be they who laud the Strong.
Glorify the Mighty Ones.

The Heavens
The Earth
The Waters
The Plants
The Trees

They filled the firmament with heavenly light.
The Devas made it beautiful.

The waters and the plants, promote the songs we sing.

The Sea
The Region
The Firmament
The Thunder
The Ocean.

All the Visvedevas shall give ear.
May we, be yours, to entertain for Offerings.
Further our offering, and please attend.

Givers of good gifts.
Quicken the hymns which we are singing now.

I follow with success upon the path.
We sing to him who dwelleth near.

To all Visvedevas.
Like friendly-minded kinsmen.
Come to our offering.
Shake down on us from above.

May they this day grant us wide space and freedom.

ye Devas.

## INDRA BUDDHA

Indra: May we live free from hostility, free from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from those who are hostile' — do devas, human beings, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas, & whatever other many kinds of beings there are, nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will, with those who are hostile?

Buddha: Devas, human beings, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas, & whatever other many kinds of beings there are, are fettered with envy & stinginess, which is why even though they think, 'May we live free from hostility, free from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from those who are hostile' they nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will, with those who are hostile.

Indra: But what, dear one, is the cause of envy & stinginess...
Indra: What is their origin?
Indra: What is their source?
Indra: What gives them birth?
Indra: When what exists do they come into being?
Indra: When what doesn't exist do they not?

Buddha: Envy & stinginess have dear-&-not-dear as their cause, have dear-&-not-dear as their origination, have dear-&-not-dear as what gives them birth, have dear-&-not-dear as their source.

Buddha: When dear-&-not-dear exist, they come into being.
Buddha: When dear-&-not-dear are not, they don't.

Indra: But what, dear one, is the cause of dear-&-not-dear, what is their origination, what gives them birth, what is their source?
Indra: When what exists do they come into being?
Indra: When what doesn't exist do they not?

Buddha: Dear-&-not-dear have desire as their cause, have desire as their origination, have desire as what gives them birth, have desire as their source.
Buddha: When desire exists, they come into being.
Buddha: When desire is not, they don't.

Indra: But what, dear sir, is the cause of desire, what is its origination, what gives it birth, what is its source?=
Indra: When what exists does it come into being?
Indra: When what doesn't exist does it not?

Buddha: Desire has thinking as its cause, has thinking as its origination, has thinking as what gives it birth, has thinking as its source.
Buddha: When thinking exists, desire comes into being.
Buddha: When thinking is not, it doesn't.

Indra: But what, dear sir, is the cause of thinking, what is its origination, what gives it birth, what is its source?
Indra: When what exists does it come into being?
Indra: When what doesn't exist does it not?

Buddha: Thinking has the perceptions & categories of objectification as its cause, has the perceptions & categories of objectification as its origination, has the perceptions & categories of objectification as what gives it birth, has the perceptions & categories of objectification as its source.
Buddha: When the perceptions & categories of objectification exist, thinking comes into being.
Buddha: When the perceptions & categories of objectification are not, it doesn't.

Indra: And how has he practiced, dear one: the monk who has practiced the practice leading to the right cessation of the perceptions & categories of objectification?

Buddha: Joy is of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued. Grief is of two sorts: to be pursued & not to be pursued. Equanimity is of two sorts: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Buddha: When one knows of a feeling of joy, As I pursue this joy, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of joy is not to be pursued.
Buddha: When one knows of a feeling of joy, As I pursue this joy, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of joy is to be pursued.
Buddha: And this sort of joy may be accompanied by directed thought & evaluation or free of directed thought & evaluation. Of the two, the latter is the more refined.
Buddha: Grief is of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Buddha: When one knows of a feeling of grief, As I pursue this grief, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of grief is not to be pursued.
Buddha: When one knows of a feeling of grief, As I pursue this grief, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of grief is to be pursued.
Buddha: And this sort of grief may be accompanied by directed thought & evaluation or free of directed thought & evaluation. Of the two, the latter is the more refined.
Buddha: Equanimity is of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Buddha: When one knows of a feeling of equanimity, As I pursue this equanimity, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of equanimity is not to be pursued.
Buddha: When one knows of a feeling of equanimity, As I pursue this equanimity, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of equanimity is to be pursued.
Buddha: And this sort of equanimity may be accompanied by directed thought & evaluation or free of directed thought & evaluation.
Buddha: This is how the monk has practiced, Deva King: the monk who has practiced the practice leading to the right cessation of the perceptions & categories of objectification.

Indra: Gratified, "So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone."
Indra: But how has he practiced, dear sir: the monk who has practiced for restraint in the #Patimokkha?

Buddha: Bodily conduct is of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Buddha: When one knows of bodily conduct, As I pursue this bodily conduct, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of bodily conduct is not to be pursued.
Buddha: When one knows of bodily conduct, As I pursue this bodily conduct, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of bodily conduct is to be pursued.
Buddha: Bodily conduct is of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Buddha: Verbal conduct is of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued.

Buddha: Searching is of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Buddha: When one knows of a search, As I pursue this search, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of search is not to be pursued.
Buddha: When one knows of a search, 'As I pursue this search, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,' that sort of search is to be pursued.
Buddha: Searching is of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Buddha: This is how he has practiced, Deva King: the monk who has practiced the practice for restraint in the #Patimokkha.

Indra: So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone.
Indra: But how has he practiced, dear sir: the monk who has practiced for restraint with regard to the sense faculties?

Buddha: Forms cognizable by the eye are of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Buddha: Sounds cognizable by the ear...
Buddha: Aromas cognizable by the nose...
Buddha: Flavors cognizable by the tongue...
Buddha: Tactile sensations cognizable by the body...
Buddha: Ideas cognizable by the intellect are of two sorts: to be pursued & not to be pursued.

Indra: Dear one, I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief statement.
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of form cognizable by the eye is not to be pursued.
Indra: But if, as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of form cognizable by the eye is to be pursued.
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of sound cognizable by the ear...
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of aroma cognizable by the nose...
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of flavor cognizable by the tongue...
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of tactile sensation cognizable by the body...
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is not to be pursued.
Indra:  But if, as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is to be pursued.
Indra: This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief statement. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome.
Indra: Dear sir, do contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal?

Buddha: No, Deva King, not all contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal.
Buddha: The world is made up of many properties, various properties. Because of the many & various properties in the world, then whichever property living beings get fixated on, they become entrenched & latch onto it, saying, 'Only this is true; anything else is false.
Buddha: This is why not all contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal.

Indra: But, dear sir, are all contemplatives utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate?

Buddha: No, Deva King, not all contemplatives are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate.

Indra: But why, dear sir, are not all contemplatives utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate?

Buddha: Those monks who are released through the total ending of craving are the ones who are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate.
Buddha: This is why not all contemplatives are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate.

Indra: So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome.
Indra: Yearning is a disease, yearning is a boil, yearning is an arrow. It seduces one, drawing one into this or that state of being, which is why one is reborn in high states & low. Whereas other outside contemplatives gave me no chance to ask them these questions, the Blessed One has answered at length, so that he has removed the arrow of my uncertainty & perplexity.

Buddha: Deva King, do you recall having asked other contemplatives these questions?

Indra: Yes, I recall having asked other contemplatives these questions.

Buddha: If it's no inconvenience, could you tell me how they answered?

Indra: It's no inconvenience when sitting with the Blessed One or one who is like him.

Buddha: Then tell me, Deva King.

Indra: Having gone to those whom I considered to be contemplatives living in isolated dwellings in the wilderness, I asked them these questions.
Indra: But when asked by me, they were at a loss. Being at a loss, they asked me in return, 'What is your name?
Indra: Being asked, I responded, 'I, dear sir, am Indra, the Deva King.
Indra: So they questioned me further, 'But what kamma did you do to attain to this state?
Indra: So I taught them the Dhamma as far as I had heard & mastered it. And they were gratified with just this much: 'We have seen Sakka, the Deva King, and he has answered our questions!' So, instead of my becoming their disciple, they simply became mine.
Indra: But I am the Blessed One's disciple, a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening.

Buddha: Deva King, do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness & joy?

Indra: Yes, I do.

Buddha: And how do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness & joy?

Indra: Once, lord, the Devas & Asuras were arrayed in battle.
Indra: And in that battle the Devas won, while the Asuras lost.
Indra: Having won the battle, as the victor in the battle, this thought occurred to me: 'Whatever has been the divine nourishment of the Asuras, whatever has been the divine nourishment of the Devas, the Devas will now enjoy both of them.
Indra: But my attainment of happiness & joy was in the sphere of violence & weapons.
Indra: It didn't lead to disenchantment, to #Passion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding.
Indra: But my attainment of happiness & joy on hearing the Blessed One's Dhamma is in the sphere of no violence, the sphere of no weapons.
Indra: It leads to disenchantment, to #Passion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding.
Indra: Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!
Indra: Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!
Indra: Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!

while: This explanation was being given, there arose to Sakka the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye.

Indra: "Whatever is returnsubject to origination is all subject to cessation"

### Hymn 3 - They who stand around him as he moves.
They who stand round him as he moves harness the bright.
The lights are shining in the sky.
Thou, making light where no light was.
Form, O men: where form was not.
Wast born together with the Dawns.
Thou, Indra, with the Tempest-Gods, the breakers down of what is firm.
Foundest the kine even in the cave.
The far-renowned, the mighty One.
Both joyous, equal in your sheen.
Come from this place, O Wanderer, or downward from the light of heaven.
Our songs of praise all yearn for this.
Indra we seek to give us help.
From here, from heaven above the earth, or from the spacious firmament.

-----------------------------------
### Hymn 4 - Indra, Singers with High Praise
INDRA the singers with high praise.
Indra reciters with their lauds.
Indra the choirs have glorified.
Indra the golden, thunder-armed.
Indra hath raised the Sun on high in heaven, that he may see afar.
Help us, O Indra, in the frays, yea, frays, where thousand spoils are gained.
In mighty battle we invoke Indra.
The Friend who bends his bolt at fiends.
Unclose, our manly Hero, thou for ever bounteous, yonder cloud.
For us, thou irresistible.
Still higher, at each strain of mine, thunder-armed Indra's praises rise.
He drives the people with his might.
The Ruler irresistible.
Indra who rules with single sway men.
We call Indra away from other men.
Ours, and none others’, may he be.

-----------------------------------
### Hymn 5 - INDRA, bring wealth that gives delight.
INDRA, bring wealth that gives delight.
Most excellent, to be our aid.
Mighty is Indra, yea supreme; greatness be his, the Thunderer.
Wide as the heaven extends his power.
Which aideth those to win them sons, who come as heroes to the fight.
Or singers loving holy thoughts.
Like wide streams from the cope of heaven.
For verily thy mighty powers, Indra, are saving helps at once.
So are his lovely gifts; let lauds and praises be to Indra sung.

-----------------------------------
### Hymn 6 - COME, Indra, and delight thee
COME, Indra, and delight thee
To Indra pour ye #Forth the juice.
The gladdening, omnific God.
O Lord of all men, fair of cheek, rejoice thee.
Present at these drink-offerings.
Songs have outpoured themselves to thee, Indra, the strong, the guardian Lord.
Send to us bounty manifold, O Indra, worthy of our wish.
For power supreme is only thine.
Indra, glorious, most splendid One.
Give, Indra, wide and lofty fame.
Grant us high fame, O Indra, grant riches.
Praising with songs the praise-worthy who cometh to our aid.
We call Indra, the Treasure-Lord of wealth.
To lofty Indra, dweller by each libation.
The pious man Sings #Forth aloud a strengthening hymn.

-----------------------------------
### Hymn 7 - The chanters hymn thee
THE chanters hymn thee.
They who say the word of praise magnify thee.
The priests have raised thee up on high.
Indra observes this wish of his.
Indra, come to listen to our songs of praise.
Come hither, answer thou the song, sing in approval, cry aloud.
Good Indra, make our meditation succeed, and prosper this our offering.
To Indra must a laud be said, to strengthen him who freely gives.
That Indra may take pleasure in our friendship and offerings.
Him, him we seek for friendship, him for riches and heroic might.
For Indra, he is Śakra, he shall aid us while he gives us wealth.
Easy to turn and drive away, Indra, is spoil bestowed by thee.
Give us wealth O Thunder-armed
The heaven and earth contain thee not, together, in thy mood.
Win us the waters of the sky, and send us kine abundantly.
Hear, thou whose ear is quick, my call; take to thee readily my songs.
O Indra, let this laud of mine come nearer even than thy friend.
We know thee mightiest of all.
Of thee most mighty we invoke the aid that giveth thousandfold.
O Indra, drink our libation with delight.
Prolong our life anew.
Lover of song.
May these our songs encompass thee.
Strengthening thee of lengthened life.
May they be dear delights.

-----------------------------------
### Hymn 8 - Sacred songs
ALL sacred songs have magnified Indra.
Strong in thy friendship, Indra, Lord of power and might, we have no fear.
We glorify with praises thee.
The gifts of Indra never fail.
When to the praise-singers he gives the boon of substance rich in kine.
Sustainer of each sacred rite, Indra, the Thunderer, much-extolled.
Lord of the thunder.
The Gods came pressing to thy side.
Song-lover, here the singers stand and testify to thee thereof.
The wily Śuṣṇa, Indra! thou o’erthrewest with thy wondrous powers.
The wise beheld this deed of thine.
Our songs of praise have glorified Indra.
Whose precious gifts in thousands come.

-----------------------------------
### Hymn 9 - Those, Indra, who are bright as suns.
Those, Indra, who are bright as suns.
Indra at early morn we call.
We call thee when the juice is shed.
Come thou to this our song of praise.
To the libation poured for thee.
Drink, Indra, to increase thy might.
Welcome to thee be this our hymn, reaching thy heart, most excellent.
To every draught of pressed-out juice.
With holy thoughts we sing thy praise.
Indra, accept the offerings we bring.
Indra, sing Your Song.

## GARUDA: SAVING THE NECTAR

Indra realised Garuda could never be defeated. So, he makes friends with the mighty being and asks him for help.

Garuda flew on, eager to give the snakes the pot and take his mother away. Indra, who had been watching him, was both impressed and anxious. As a last-ditch effort, Indra threw his Vajrayudh, the thunderbolt, at Garuda.

But it had no impact. Overawed, Indra approached Garuda and said,

“Oh king of birds, I have never known anyone as strong as you. I would like to stop fighting with you. Please let us be friends.”

Seeing that Indra was in earnest, Garuda agreed. As they both chatted, Indra asked:

“Even my powerful Vajrayudh didn’t harm you. Can you tell me how strong you are?”

Garuda laughed, “Thanks to the powers bestowed upon me, I can support the entire world on a single feather.”

An amazed Indra realised that no army could ever defeat this mighty being. He decided to throw himself at Garuda’s mercy. “Since you are now my friend, I will be frank with you. I do not want the snakes to drink the nectar and become immortal. If that happens, they might begin to harass people.”

Garuda agreed. “But to free my mother and myself, I have to give them the amrit. What shall we do?” The two came up with a plan.

Garuda flew off with the nectar. When he reached their dwelling, he showed the snakes the pot. Overjoyed, they immediately freed Vinata and Garuda. Now it was time to put the plan into action. Garuda placed the pot on a bed of kusha grass and suggested cunningly:

“Shouldn’t you all bathe and purify yourselves before you drink the nectar?”

The snakes accepted the suggestion and went off to bathe in the river. Once they had all left, Indra who had been an invisible spectator quickly picked up the pot of nectar. Holding it safe, he said, “Thank you for your help. Ask me anything and I’ll grant your wish.”

Garuda thought over what he wanted. All this occurred only because his mother had been ill-treated by Kadru and her sons. They had to be taught a lesson.

“Let snakes be my natural food, henceforth,” he said. Indra granted the wish and left, happy to have saved the nectar from the snakes. Garuda too lifted his mother on to his back and flew away.

When the snakes came back, they found the nectar missing. Hoping that some drops may have fallen down, they licked the kusha grass but its sharp blades cut their tongues. And so, legend has it, that snakes have had forked tongues
since then.

Then they became:
- The Greatest of Friends.

## HANUMAN: SOARING TOWARDS THE SUN

The monkey god, Hanuman, is known to be invincible and immortal. How did he get these powers?

Hanuman was the son of Vayu, the god of the wind, and Anjana, a celestial nymph. You’re probably wondering how the son of the wind god and a nymph turned out to be a monkey. The answer is that Anjana once angered a sage who
cursed her to be born as a monkey. When the nymph begged for pardon, the sage calmed down and said that she would regain her original form after she bore a son who would win great renown.

Even as a child, Hanuman had great powers. One morning, he saw the sun rising and thought it was a great yellow ball. He decided to get hold of it so that he could play with it. Indra, the king of gods, saw Hanuman leap into the sky and wanted to stop him. And how did he do that? He threw his weapon, the Vajra (thunderbolt) at the child. Hanuman fell to earth, wounded.

Hanuman’s enraged father decided to go on a strike until the one who hurt his child was punished. Imagine if there is no wind on earth! How would it be? No gentle cooling breeze when the sun blazes down. No power to move the rain-bearing clouds. Why, after a point, both humans and animals couldn’t breathe. Vayu’s strike made life on earth difficult.

The gods knew they had to placate Vayu. So, they offered the baby a multitude of boons.

Indra’s boon was that the Vajra would no longer hurt the child and that his body would be stronger than the weapon.

@Varuna, the god of the ocean, offered him protection from water.

@Agni, the god of fire, blessed him with immunity to fire.

@Surya, the sun god, gave him the power to change the size of his body.

@Yama blessed him with good health and immortality.

Vishwakarma, the divine architect, offered a boon that Hanuman would be safe from all objects of his creation.

With all these boons, Hanuman became a great warrior who protects all children from harm.

## END WORLD PROTOCOLS

If envy or lust become noticeable in consequence of their yielding to desire, then, according to what has been ordained, such can never prevail. Charmed by me, @Agni will be instantly extinguished, even if he blazes up all around for consuming all creatures.

The energy with which I am endued is indeed great, but know that if the Earth cleaves in twain, or mountain crests split, I can re-unite them by my chants before the eyes of all.

If for the destruction of this universe of animate and inanimate, mobile and immobile creatures, there happeneth a terrific tempest or stony shower of loud roar, I can always, from compassion for created beings, stop it before the
eyes of all.

When the waters are solidified by me, even cars and infantry can move over them. It is I who set a going all the affairs of both Gods and Devas.

Unto whatever countries I go on any mission, my steeds move where I desire. Within my dominions there are no fearful snakes, and protected by my chants, creatures within my territories are never injured by others that are
frightful.

The very clouds dwelling in my dominions, showers as much as they desire and when they desire.

All my subjects are devoted and are never subject to calamities of season.

My intelligence is superior, my energy is superior, my prowess is superior, my knowledge is superior, my resources are superior by far to those of other ways.

Whatever knowledge of weapons is in the Universe exist in me as well.

## VAK - THE DEMON QUEEN

WARNING: This is a warning to all DEVA about VAK and her Party.

With sacrifice the trace of Vāk they followed.
Found her harbouring within the Ṛṣis.

One man hath ne’er seen Vāk, and yet he sees.
One man hath hearing but hath never heard.

No part in Vāk hath he who knows the truth of friendship.
Even if he hears her still in vain he listens.

They leave one far behind through their attainments.
Those men who step not back and move not forward.

Having attained to Vāk in sinful fashion spin out their thread in ignorance like spinsters.

He is Visnu their blame-averter

One plies his constant task reciting verses
One more tells the lore of being
One lays down the rules of sacrificing.

Her commrade to the right is Visnu.
She TRAVELs with the Rudras, the Vasus, with the Ādityas.
She bends the bow for Rudra that his arrow may strike and slay the hater of her devotion.

She will rouse and order battle for the people.
She has penetrated Earth and Heaven.

She makes the man she loves exceedingly mighty.
She has become mighty in her grandeur.

She is the Queen of Demons.

Let not the fiend of witchcraft-workers reach us.
Indra keep us safe from earthly woe and trouble.
From Heaven mid-air preserve us.

Let the fools' gods with bent necks raise.
See Indra when he arrives.
Look each one hither, watch ye well.
